				<h2>Who I am</h2>
				<div class="content align-left">
					<p>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/hands.jpg" alt=""></span>
						Between 2007 and 2012, I studied midwifery in France and received my certification. This education focused on both normal and high risk pregnancy, pediatrics and preventive gynecology. Actual patient practice was a huge part of my education. As a student, I delivered 101 babies, including twins, triplets, breeches and premature babies. I experienced a lot of intense moments that are forever imprinted in my memory!<br><br>
						During my schooling, I also worked as a child care assistant in two different Parisian maternities. It gave me an even better knowledge of  breastfeeding and postnatal care. <br><br>
						Then, I worked for a year as a midwife in Saint-Maurice and Lariboisière maternities in Paris (labor room and postnatal care) where I delivered 78 babies the natural way, and helped a few others during the cesarean section. <br><br>
						As I developed my pre/post natal skills I was able to fulfill my dream of opening my own office near Paris. During three years, my expertise included: insuring prenatal consultations, birth preparation with relaxation, consultations at home to monitor high risk pregnancies and help parents with their newborn after they came back from hospital. I also taught Ayurvedic baby massage and practiced preventive gynecology, including contraception, and pelvic rehabilitation.
					</p>
					<h4>A few numbers about my practice as an independent midwife : </h4>
					<ul>
						<li>1085 pregnancy consultations and monitorings</li>
						<li>900 birth preparation courses</li>
						<li>900 post natal consultations</li>
						<li>4500 pelvic rehab sessions</li>
						<li>45 baby massage workshops</li>
						<li>500 gynecologic consultations</li>
						<li>2 homebirths</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/frame.jpg" alt=""></span>
						During these three years, I also received a diploma in pain management in the pre and postnatal period, as well as full training in pelvic rehabilitation.<br><br>
						At the end of 2015, I moved to Florida with my husband to support his professional pursuits. These last two years were a great opportunity to learn English and Spanish while immersing myself in American culture. I met and worked with many interesting people from different areas: Organic Farmers, Herbalists, Doulas, Chefs, Nutritionists and Artists. I am multifaceted now and I am really grateful for the experience I was given to live in the States.<br><br>
						I am particularly excited to adapt my recent experiences into interacting with parents and babies. I look forward to supporting you in Brooklyn and connecting with my passion and my art of being a birth professional. My years of experience as a French midwife uniquely position me to be an incredible resource to you as Doula, both by providing technical knowledge and spiritual support.

				<h2>What I do</h2>
				<p class="content align-left">
					As I am new to Brooklyn and the doula system in the US, I have not  set a rate for what I propose but a suggested donation instead. I believe that people will be honest according to their own means and level of satisfaction with my services, valuing my time and devotion for them in a fair way. Whether you can give more or less than the suggestion is not the most important. To me, every woman deserves a trustworthy and non-judgmental help during her pregnancy.<br><br>
					If you choose me as your doula, you can custom tailor a program to your needs based on the following services.

					<h2>Prenatal meeting at your place</h2>
					<p>90 to 120 minutes - suggested donation $75</p>
				</header>
				<p>At least one visit is mandatory if you want me to be present during your labor and birth. It is recommended to organize a birth preparation as well. When I am with you, we can use your time as you want. If you need to talk mostly, that is what we will do. If you need help to understand a special treatment or diet, or if you want to start making a birth plan, I’m here for you. I can also attend visits to your hospital, birth center or at your midwife’s office when you have a medical appointment. </p>

					<h2>Birth preparation courses</h2>
					<p>60 to 90 minutes - suggested donation $50</p>
				</header>
				<p>The themes can be anything and everything that you care or have questions about. A first meeting will help determine a schedule that suits you best. In France, we often organize seven sessions during which I talk about the following subjects: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Anatomy of pregnancy and the different situations of emergency</li>
					<li>The uterus contraction / how to handle the pain during labor</li>
					<li>Labor, mobility, postures / medical interventions as epidural, labor induction, C-section</li>
					<li>Expulsive efforts and posture for birth</li>
					<li>Pelvic floor and related questions before and after the birth</li>
					<li>Breastfeeding</li>
					<li>The newborn care and the new rhythm in the parents’ life</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Relaxation and exercises can be practiced during those lessons, customized according to your needs. The courses could be organized with other women / couples as desired, a good opportunity to hear the famous "stupid" questions which are usually beneficial for everyone!</p>

							<blockquote>I contacted Marion after the delivery of my first daughter in 2014 for postnatal care at home. I appreciated my first contact with her. She is a nice person, sweet and kind. As a first time mom, she was able to guide me to apprehend the contact with my baby. She also supported me for breastfeeding. She has been comforting in this complicated moment for me.<br><br>
								For my second pregnancy, I highly regretted not to be followed by Marion. Indeed I had to be put under an obstetrician care for a twin pregnancy.<br><br>
								Marion is a very professional person, as sweet with her patients as she is with newborn babies. She loves her job and we can feel it.

								Marion, my midwife, my first pregnancy, my first baby.<br><br>
								I didn’t start my pregnancy with Marion : I had a gynecologist with whom it went very badly. I met Marion on the advice of a friend. I really appreciated her accompaniment, advices, zenitude and her childbirth preparation sessions. She is very soothing and serene. She conveys her feelings while leaving you the choice to think for yourself and make your own choices<br><br>
								She told me a sentence that marked me : “your are made to give birth and your baby knows how to be born”. I kept this in mind when I went into labor and during the delivery. I think it helped me to be positive concerning the arrival of my baby and I thank her for that !

								I took an appointment with Marion during my second pregnancy. She was practicing in the only midwife’s office of my city at that time. I found her by chance, the closest midwife I could find from home and work. It was a second pregnancy, four years after the first one, and I was a little apprehensive about preparing for childbirth. Would it be helpful to take lessons again ? I didn’t have much interactions with the medical profession between those to pregnancies. Finally, the contact went well. Dealing with a young person reassured me because “old” midwives do not necessarily have a good reputation…<br>
								Marion has been welcoming, reassuring, the discussion has always been very easy. She was listening and we shared some experiences and feedback (I’m thinking about the capsules of horse chestnut, really efficient !) <br><br>
								I naturally turned to her after my delivery, for post natal care at home and pelvic rehab (accompanied by my rascal oldest son). She was always available to give me breast pump rental orders !<br><br>
								When I got pregnant for the third time, she provided monthly pregnancy consultations, in addition to birth preparation. This is when Marion stopped working in Noisy-le-Grand. If she came back, I would visit her again with trust.

								I wanted to tell you about my meeting with Marion who reconciled me with childbirth ! First, I met Marion at her office in Noisy-le-Grand because I wanted to have another midwife for my second pregnancy. For the first one, I had to deal with a woman who had no pedagogy and did not answer my questions. Isn’t a midwife supposed to reassure you and give you confidence ? This first one didn’t and I went through the worst childbirth I could imagine ! Anyway…<br><br>
								I met Marion at her office and she was able to reassure me, to advise and to guide me with her soft and kind voice. I attended her delivery classes and everything was clear, her explanations and advice reassured me. I was able to enjoy my birth, I lived it fully !!<br>
								I urge you to see her to live your pregnancy serenely and no longer apprehend childbirth. Live it the best you can as a future mother !

							<blockquote>
								I was lucky to meet Marion during my second pregnancy. As I didn’t have any contact with a midwife during the first one, I really wanted something different. Marion met me quite early and I immediately liked her sweetness and contact. Extremely listening, she knew how to put me at ease very fast, and we know how important it is during this particular period.<br><br>
								I had a classical pregnancy, without any particular trouble. Each meeting with Marion was a real joy. She took her time and this is really pleasant. I was telling her about my worries concerning the great sister and my pregnancy ills, and she always knew how to calm me down.<br><br>
								I also decided to have my birth preparation with her. We were in a small group of 3 people and even if I remembered the courses during my first pregnancy, with Marion it was more simple, more practical.<br><br>
								Marion met my little Pauline a few days after her birth, for postnatal care. She came home : what a joy to share that moment with her ! And after that, I did the pelvic rehab with her. It is also Marion who set my IUD, without any pain.<br><br>
								I take advantage of this testimonial to tell Marion that she has been a real little fairy during this second pregnancy, and I keep a wonderful souvenir of that accompaniment. Thank you Marion !

								Marion accompanied me during the pregnancy of my little daughter now 4 years old. What a beautiful meeting !<br>
								I chose Marion because she was doing a preparation for childbirth with sophrology. I had recorded the sophrology sessions of Marion and I broadcast them every evening to relax, she really accompanied me to the end. And having had a lot of disappointment from the medical profession and having changed twice my obstetrician gynecologist, (I really dreaded the pain of the auscultations) what a joy to meet Marion, her softness and natural simplicity. I was already very close from my baby with whom I managed to communicate in utero, but the sophrology of Marion brought me a completely different relation to childbirth : the fact that I was not going to live this moment alone but with my little girl for whom, this moment would also be very testing. This vision totally changed my perception of childbirth, and despite a long delivery (39h) with some complications, I did not utter a single cry, voluntarily and without effort. Marion has found the words that allowed me to live my birth serenely, naturally, without asking any questions and thinking about my baby. And with her sophrology, I waited for every appointment with impatience, not only for this reassuring moment of relaxation, but also because we had real exchanges and it was so good for my morale, a real breeze of freshness and cheerfulness.<br><br>
								I really recommend her, sincerely.
